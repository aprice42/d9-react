# Drupal 9 and Progressive Decoupling Experiments
This is a space where I am exploring possibilities of progressive decoupling with React and Drupal.

## Installation
- `composer install`

- Create a database
- Update settings.php database connection info

- `drush site-install`
- `drush en test_react`

## Current Functionality
- Place the Cards block to see a simple react based front-end example
